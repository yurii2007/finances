### Second step

```
Creating UI skeleton for the first pages necessary for testing the basic functionality
```

### Third step

```
Create the project architecture, connect to the database (decide what will be the database, or just use json as a data holder for now)
```

### Fourth step

```
Create an interface for the welcome page, create a kind of guide for the available (not now, of course) features, and explain to the user (me and another orange fella) what the app does and what the meaning of human existence is
```

### Fifth step

```
Configure CI/CD, add tests with documentation
```
